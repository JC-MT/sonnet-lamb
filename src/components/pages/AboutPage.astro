      Sonnet made the big move to New York City in 2020 with her very cute
      husband, Jan. She is often found at the piano, in the dance studio, or
      obsessively cleaning her already clean apartment. Sonnet is loving living
      the dream, and looks forward to starring anything opposite Ryan Reynolds.
